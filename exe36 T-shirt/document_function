//FUNCTION:-
-----------
What is a Function?
A function is like a small program inside your program. It's a way to group together a set of instructions that you can use whenever you need them.

How to Define a Function?
In TypeScript, you can define a function like this:

function greet(name: string): string {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
function:
 This keyword tells TypeScript that we're creating a function.
greet: This is the name of our function.
(name: string): These are the parameters the function takes. Here, it's saying the function needs a name, which should be a string.
: string: This is saying that our function will return a string.
How to Use a Function?
Once you've defined a function, you can use it:
as:-
const greeting = greet("Alice");
console.log(greeting);
Here, we're calling (using) the greet function and passing the name "Alice". The function returns a greeting, and we store that greeting in the greeting variable. Finally, we print it out.

**Functions Can Do More:
Functions can do various things. They can take multiple parameters, perform calculations, or even not return anything (void). Here's an example:

function addNumbers(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
}

const sum = addNumbers(5, 3);
console.log(sum);
In this example, addNumbers takes two numbers, adds them together, and returns the result.

***Functions Can be Flexible:
Functions can be flexible with optional parameters and default values:

function greet(name?: string): string {
    if (name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    } else {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}

const greeting1 = greet("Bob");
const greeting2 = greet();
console.log(greeting1); // Output: Hello, Bob!
console.log(greeting2); // Output: Hello!
In this case, name?: string means the name parameter is optional. If you provide a name, it uses it; otherwise, it defaults to a generic greeting.

Summary:
Definition: A function is like a mini-program that performs a specific task.
Syntax: function functionName(parameters): returnType { /* code */ }
Usage: Call a function with functionName(arguments).
Parameters: Input values that a function can use.
Return Type: The type of value the function will give back.
Functions are fundamental in programming and make your code more organized, reusable, and easier to understand. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable pieces.

//STATIC TYPINDG TS MEANS:-
-------------------------
Static typing refers to a programming language feature where variable types are known and checked at compile-time rather than runtime. Here are some key characteristics of static typing:

Explicit Type Declarations: In statically-typed languages, you need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. For example, in TypeScript:

typescript
Copy code
let age: number;
age = 25; // Valid
age = "twenty-five"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
Compile-Time Checking: The compiler checks for type errors before the code is executed. If there is a type mismatch or violation, the compiler generates an error, preventing the program from running.

Early Error Detection: Since type checking occurs at compile-time, errors related to type mismatches or incorrect use of variables are caught early in the development process. This can help developers identify and fix issues before running the program.

Performance Optimization: The knowledge of variable types at compile-time allows the compiler to optimize the generated machine code for better performance, as it can make assumptions about the types used in the program.

Improved Code Documentation: Type declarations serve as a form of documentation, making it clear to developers what types of values variables are expected to hold. This can enhance code readability and maintenance.

Languages like TypeScript, Java, C++, and Swift are examples of statically-typed languages. In contrast, dynamically-typed languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python) perform type checking at runtime, allowing more flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors if types are misused.

While static typing has its advantages in terms of catching errors early and improving code documentation, some developers prefer the flexibility provided by dynamically-typed languages, where variables can change types during runtime. Each approach has its trade-offs, and the choice between static and dynamic typing often depends on the specific needs and preferences of the developers and the nature of the project.
